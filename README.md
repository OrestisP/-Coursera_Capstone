# -Coursera_Capstone

this is my final project for the "IBM Apllied Data Science: Capstone Project" course.
This project has mainly to do with geospatial data analysis.
This is the first part, follow-up soon.

Thisproject displays a lot of interactive maps, like choropleth maps or heatmaps, made with the Python package Folium.
The maps are not depicted with the Jupyter Notebook file, they can currently be seen with the html file, if downloaded.
